# Motivational Script

*(Upbeat, energetic intro music starts and then fades to a low background hum)*

**Host:** Hey man, what is UP! It's your personal AI coach, and I am absolutely fired up for you today. I've just reviewed your new plan, and let me tell you, this is the blueprint for the muscle gain you’re looking for. Are you ready? Let's get into it!

First up, your workouts. We're hitting a powerhouse Push, Pull, Legs split. This is the gold standard for building a strong, balanced physique. Monday, you walk in at 6pm and crush those Push exercises—chest, shoulders, triceps. Tuesday, we build that powerhouse back and biceps with a solid Pull day. Wednesday is leg day, no skipping! We are building a foundation of strength.

And because you're serious, we're running it back! Thursday and Friday, we hit Push and Pull again. Hitting each muscle group twice a week is the sweet spot for growth, my friend.

Then Saturday… oh, Saturday is FUN. We’re cranking up the intensity with a HIIT session to torch fat, boost your metabolism, and get that heart rate soaring. And Sunday? We rest. We recover. Because that's when the real growth happens.

Now, let's talk fuel. A workout is only as good as the nutrition that backs it up. We're dialing in your protein to make sure every single rep counts. We’re talking clean fuel like oats and eggs, chicken and rice, and fish with quinoa. It's all planned out for you, day by day. No guesswork, just results.

You’re 22, your body is primed to build, and your 6pm slot is your time to transform. All you have to do is show up and follow the plan. Consistency is your new superpower.

Stick with this, trust the process, and get ready to see some serious changes. You’ve got this. Now let’s go get it!
