Hey, what is up! It's your friendly AI Fitness Coach, and I am fired up because your weekly game plan is officially locked and loaded. You told me you want to build muscle, and my friend, this week is where we make it happen.

I see you’ve carved out that 6 PM slot every weekday. That’s dedication, and that's the energy we're going to build on!

Alright, let's break it down. Your workout schedule is a powerhouse Push-Pull-Legs split. We're hitting every muscle group with intensity and precision from Monday to Friday. Think of it like this: every session, you're laying another brick on the foundation of the physique you want. Then, Saturday, we hit that HIIT session to supercharge your metabolism and keep you athletic!

But listen up, because this next part is the secret weapon: nutrition. Workouts tear the muscle down, but food builds it back up stronger. We're making a simple, powerful switch this week—fueling your body with the high-quality protein it’s been craving. That chicken, those eggs, that fish… that’s not just food. That is the raw material for growth! Every meal on this plan is a direct investment in your goal.

And Sunday? We rest. We recover. We grow.

So, the plan is set. The code is written. Your job is simple: show up at 6 PM, give it your all, and fuel your body right. Consistency is your superpower this week. You've got this. Now let's go crush it!
