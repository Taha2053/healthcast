# Motivational Script

*(Upbeat, energetic intro music starts and fades into the background)*

**Host (AI Coach):** What's up, superstar! It’s your friendly AI Fitness Coach, and I am FIRED UP. Why? Because I’ve just finished calibrating your personal blueprint for success, and it is looking absolutely awesome.

You told me you’re ready to build some serious muscle, and you’ve got that 6 PM weekday slot ready to go. So, let’s make it happen!

This week is all about laying the foundation. We're jumping into a killer Push-Pull-Legs split. On Monday and Thursday, we’re gonna be building that powerful chest and those boulder shoulders on our **Push Days**. Tuesday and Friday, it’s all about crafting that V-taper back and building strong biceps on our **Pull Days**. And Wednesday? Oh, you know it. We are NEVER skipping **Leg Day**!

We’ll cap off the hard work with a high-energy HIIT session on Saturday to torch fat and boost your metabolism. Then comes Sunday—your champion’s rest day. That’s when the real growth happens, so embrace it!

Now, the work in the gym is only half the battle. I’ve analyzed your nutrition data, and we’re making a simple, powerful switch: boosting that protein to fuel your gains. We’re talking lean chicken, fish, eggs… this is the high-quality fuel your body is craving to repair and build.

Look, you’ve got the goal. You’ve got the schedule. And now, you have the perfect plan. Your only job is to show up and give it your all. Every workout you complete, every meal you stick to, you're casting a vote for the stronger, more powerful version of yourself.

You've got this. I know you do. Now let's get to work!
